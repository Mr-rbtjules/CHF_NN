The architecture of this project :

my_model.py -> the class handeling a defined model with defined HP
and based on DNN for regression task CHF prediction (1 output)
handle model and HP saving/loading , logs of training and plot
of architecture/results
include DATA wich is a dict containing
the different training data needed regrouped by seed
DATA = {seed:processed_data}
processed_data is the data ready to be directly used for the model
processed_data is a dict with the different keys:
'validation_targets'
'validation_features'
'training_features'
'training_targets'
'mean'
'std'


optimizer.py -> class to create study of HP optimisation
handle multiprocessing search with a common database to save the
results and make better guess each time



tensorboard.py -> when create is going to construct logs in 
the way of loading tensorboard hp comparison, regroup the hparams and
create the logable_hparams for the models of interest (to compare)
 or all



tools.py -> all the small functions
config.py -> some config
