The architecture of this project :

my_model.py -> the class handeling a defined model with defined HP
and based on DNN for regression task CHF prediction (1 output)

optimizer.py -> 1 object= 1 type of architecture we want to optimise

tensorboard.py -> when create is going to construct logs in 
the way of loading tensorboard hp comparison, regroup the hparams and create the
logable_hparams for the models of interest (to compare) or all

but for that we need a wrapper that record hparams evry time train_model
is used and make the link with the future logs (name of the model)


tools.py -> all the small functions 

config.py -> some config
